  <div class="specification">
    <p class="fact">Hedgehogs are easily recognized by their spines, which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin. Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies.</p>
    <ul>	
      <li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Erinaceinae</li>
      <li><span>Average Length</span>: 25 centimeters</li>
      <li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 4-7 years </li>
      <li><span>Habitat</span>: Hedgerows</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal, though some species can also be active during the day. Hedgehogs sleep for a large portion of the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug in the ground, with varying habits among the species.
